# Stable_Marriage_Problem
It is also called Stable Matching Problem.
There are two groups with equal number of individuals, which everyone has a preference matrix to choose someone from the other group.
A well-known real-world application of this problem and its solving algorithm is in assigning users to servers in an internet service like web pages.
The solving algorithm is based on constraint programming principles. This way, we tend to make decisions for individuals, and if it works and they prefer to get married to each other (meaning that they donâ€™t violate the constraint), they will be removed from the list as a couple, and they will be removed from the preferences of remaining individuals as well. for more information about contraint programming see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming#:~:text=Constraint%20programming%20(CP)%20is%20a,a%20set%20of%20decision%20variables.
If you are interested in studying more about constraint programming, I recommend you to read "Handbook of constraint programming" by F.Rossi, P.Van Beek, and T.Walsh
